# PyTorrent - Bugs & Features Analysis

## üêõ CRITICAL BUGS TO FIX

### 1. **Compatibility Issues**
- **libtorrent API Deprecation** (`torrent_manager.py:25-31`)
  - Using deprecated `get_settings()` and `apply_settings()` methods
  - Should use `settings_pack` for libtorrent 2.0+
  - Current approach may cause crashes on newer libtorrent versions

### 2. **Error Handling & Stability**
- **No Error Recovery** (`torrent_manager.py:79, 111`)
  - Exceptions only print to console, no user notification
  - Failed torrents remain in broken state
  - Should show error dialogs and allow retry
  
- **Missing Resume Data Handling** (`torrent_manager.py:272-292`)
  - Resume data is saved but never loaded on startup
  - Downloads restart from beginning after app restart
  - Major usability issue

### 3. **File Selection Not Implemented** (`add_torrent_dialog.py:216-236`)
- **Selective Download Broken**
  - `get_selected_files()` method exists but isn't used in `torrent_manager.py`
  - Users can't actually choose which files to download
  - File priorities are never set on the torrent handle

### 4. **Settings Not Applied** (`preferences_dialog.py`)
- **Settings Saved But Not Used**
  - All preferences are saved to QSettings but never applied to session
  - Bandwidth limits, connection limits, port changes have no effect
  - Major disconnect between UI and functionality

### 5. **Memory Leaks**
- **Torrent Info Cache** (`torrent_manager.py:42`)
  - Cache grows indefinitely, never cleaned up
  - Could cause memory issues with many torrents over time

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY BUGS

- **No Torrent State Persistence**
  - Torrent list is cleared on restart
  - No way to restore session state
  
- **Poor Progress Indication**
  - No visual progress bars in tree widget
  - ETA calculations can show "‚àû" or weird values
  
- **Missing Context Menus**
  - Right-click on torrents does nothing
  - No quick access to common actions

### 7. **Threading Issues**
- **UI Blocking Operations** (`add_torrent_dialog.py:98-123`)
  - Loading torrent info blocks UI thread
  - Should be async for large torrents
  
### 8. **File Management**
- **No Download Directory Validation**
  - Doesn't check if directory exists or is writable
  - Could fail silently when adding torrents
